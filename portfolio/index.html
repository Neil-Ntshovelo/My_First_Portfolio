            <p>
                Hi, I'm Ntshovelo Nell Munetwa, a junior front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. 
                My journey into coding has been driven by a passion for creating clean, functional, and responsive user interfaces. 
                Over the course of my career, I've worked on projects ranging from banking applications to inventory management systems. 
                I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and take on new challenges that push the boundaries of web development. 
                Whether it's problem-solving, collaborating with teams, or diving deep into code, I enjoy bringing ideas to life on the web.

            <h2>about Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I am a junior front-end developer with a genuine passion for crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences. 
                My journey into the world of coding started with a curiosity about how websites work and a desire to build something from scratch. 
                I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, and I have had the opportunity to work on projects like banking applications and inventory systems and more. 
                I love tackling new challenges and learning from each project I undertake. 
                Outside of coding, I am always exploring new ideas and thinking about how technology can make life a little bit easier and more enjoyable (e.g learning new technologies)
